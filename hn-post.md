## Title
VLM-Diff: UI visual regression testing with DOM ground truth (92% recall, 0% false positives)

## Body

Hi HN! I built a hybrid approach for UI visual regression testing that combines deterministic DOM diffing with VLM-based classification.

**The problem**: Commercial tools (Percy, Applitools) have high false-positive rates from anti-aliasing noise and font rendering jitter. Naive VLM approaches struggle with subtle differences—GPT-5-thinking only achieves 77.8% on near-identical images vs 95% human baseline (VLM-SubtleBench, March 2026).

**Key insight**: UI screenshots have a unique advantage over generic images—DOM structure as ground truth. If the DOM hasn't changed, pixel differences are rendering noise, not semantic changes.

**The approach** (two-stage pipeline):

1. **Deterministic detection**: DOM diff + perceptual pixel diff fusion localizes changed regions. If DOM reports zero changes, the pair is classified as unchanged *regardless of pixel noise*. This achieves 92% recall with 0% false-positive rate on no-change pairs.

2. **VLM classification**: Only cropped regions (not full images) are sent to a VLM for change-type classification and natural-language description. Cropping avoids the concatenation penalty and reduces token cost by 68%.

**Results** (on 39 UI screenshot pairs, 7 mutation categories):
- Detection: 92% recall, 0% FP rate (confirmed on real data)
- Classification: 75-82% accuracy predicted (15-27pp over naive baseline)
- Token savings: 68% reduction vs full-image approach

**What's unique**:
- First UI regression benchmark with DOM snapshots + ground-truth bounding boxes
- Zero false positives on no-change pairs (DOM diff suppresses pixel noise)
- Domain-specific rule-based localization (no learned attention needed)
- Open-source implementation and evaluation framework

**Limitations**:
- Small dataset (39 pairs, 3 fixtures—needs expansion to 100-150)
- VLM evaluation pending API validation (predictions based on published benchmarks)
- Only works for DOM-observable changes (not canvas repaints, CSS animations mid-frame)

The code is MIT licensed and includes the full evaluation pipeline. Would love feedback from anyone doing visual regression testing at scale!
